            <h2>What are healing and medicinal plants?</h2>
                <p>
                    Plants are life. Our lives depend on the pre-existence of the plants around us. They form our wondrous environment, nourishing and healing both our body and soul, and without plants nothing could survive on our beautiful planet. Plants are at the basis of our evolution, civilizations and cultures. In addition, there are countless 'medicinal plants' among the 250,000-400,000 different species of flowering plants in the world. They can help us physically, mentally and spiritually.

            <h2>The history of healing and medicinal plants</h2>
                <p>
                    If they have something wrong, birds and other animals instinctively seem to know what they need, and even pets still seem to have this gift in part. Their innate ability to find the right medicinal plants has evolved from generation to generation through mistakes and right choices. If something really works, animals will promptly apply it.
