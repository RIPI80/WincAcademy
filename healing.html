    <h2>The basics</h2>
      <p>
        Many conventional medicines are derived directly from plants. Nevertheless, plant medicine is the only accessible option for eighty percent of the world's population and more and more people in the West are also using medicinal plants as self-medication or in combination with regular treatment.

    <h2>How to use medicinal plants</h2>
      <p>
        The quality of plants used in a treatment is very important, as is accurately identifying plant species and their correct application. The effectiveness of plants and their preparation depends on this.
      </p>
      <h3>Collection</h3>
        <p>
          Collect plants in dry weather and after the dew has evaporated, to prevent loss of quality and mold. Choose plants that look perfect. Let the plants dry spread out in a well-ventilated area, before storing them.
        </p>
      <h3>Preservation</h3>
        <p>
          Store dried plants from the sun, in airtight pots. Create labels with the name of the plant and the picking date. If the picking date is not known, the smell and color of dried plants are a good indication of freshness.
        </p>
      <h3>Applications</h3>
        <p>
          Essences, essential oils and parts of medicinal plants are all used in toiletries, perfumes and patented medicines. Think of capsules, elixirs, extracts, incense, massage oil, cough tablets, flooriable and dried herbal mixtures, oils, spreads, pastilles, powders, soaps, suppositories, tablets, inhalants and blossom waters.
